title: Reflections on a Year with Git(Hub)
---

This is the first blog post, and I'd dedicate it to the _tool_ that I've been using regularly since I first learned it, i.e., version control, specifically git.
This post is more like a personal narrative than a technical one, chronicling my git journey so far.

## Introduction

It's been a year since I first learned about git and GitHub. Over the past year, I've extensively used them for my projects, open-source contributions, random explorations etc.  
My initial motivation for learning git was to participate in Google Summer of Code 2024, which, sadly, I couldn't. However, learning git was an enriching experience in itself. I already had a GitHub account, which I created back in 11th grade. I participated in a web development competition back then and read about GitHub somewhere. Fast forward 2 years, I was in my first semester at IIT Kanpur when I first learned about GSoC. For some inexplicable reason, I was drawn towards the idea of open source. When my semester ended and I returned home, I set out to learn more about GSoC.
