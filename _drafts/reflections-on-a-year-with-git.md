title: Reflections on a Year with Git(Hub)
---

This is the first blog post, and I'd dedicate it to the _tool_ that I've been using regularly since I first learned it, i.e., version control, specifically git.

This post is more like a personal narrative than a technical one, chronicling my git journey so far.

## Introduction

It's been more than a year since I first learned about git and GitHub. Over the past year, I've extensively used git for my projects, open-source contributions, random explorations etc.  
As I look back to my GitHub contributions heatmaps, I realise how integral Git(Hub) has been to my learning and open source journey.

## Why Git?

I was in my first semester at IIT Kanpur when I first learned about GSoC. The concept of open source, for some inexplicable reason, captivated me.  
When my semester ended and I returned home, I set out to learn more about it. I quickly realized that GSoC, like modern software development, relies heavily on version control.

My initial motivation for learning Git was to participate in Google Summer of Code 2024, although I ultimately was unable to do so. Nonetheless, the experience of learning Git was enriching in its own right.
