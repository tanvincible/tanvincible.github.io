In this post, I'll discuss an efficient algorithm for finding the divisors of even perfect numbers in \(O(log N)\) time. Since no odd perfect numbers are known, this method specifically applies to even ones.  

Here’s the pseudocode for the algorithm:  

```bash
Require: An integer p representing the Mersenne exponent  
Ensure: A list of proper divisors of the even perfect number associated with p  

Initialize an empty list `divisors`  
Set `value` to 1  
Append `value` to `divisors`  

for i = 1 to p − 1 do  
    `value ← value × 2`  
    Append `value` to `divisors`  
end for  

Set `mersenne_prime` to `(value × 2) − 1`  
Append `mersenne_prime` to `divisors`  

Set `value` to `mersenne_prime`  
for i = 1 to p − 2 do  
    `value ← value × 2`  
    Append `value` to `divisors`  
end for  

Return `divisors`  
```

This approach leverages the structure of even perfect numbers, which are always of the form \( 2^{p-1} \times (2^p - 1) \) when \( 2^p - 1 \) is a Mersenne prime.  
By iterating through the powers of \(2\) up to \( p-1 \) and then incorporating the Mersenne prime factor, we efficiently generate all divisors in logarithmic time.
