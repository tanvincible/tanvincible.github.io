I have been thinking about blogging for almost a year, but it never caught on for some reason. Finally, after months, here I am (at the end of 2024), writing my first-ever blog post. For this one, I'll write my thoughts behind the WHY. I will also include things I'm involved in and things you might see in my future posts (I hope they happen, fingers crossed).

One of the key reasons I decided to write blogs in the first place is to keep track of things I learned, am learning, and plan to learn. I have varied interests revolving around various topics, say, in a broader sense, software development, number theory, AI/ML, etc., and I also tend to forget things along the way. I reckon these blogs will be helpful if I want to look back.

Secondly, since the release of ChatGPT, I have relied on it too much. I use it as my automation tool, asking it to write emails, docs, reports, etc. In short, for any writing task requiring creativity and some thinking, I let ChatGPT take charge, resulting in my writing skills downgrading (as evident in this post). Anyway, I reckon writing blogs will help lessen the side effects of using the chatbot.

Coming to things (the major ones) I am involved in (currently), there is [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/), the [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) Jekyll theme (that I maintain), [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io/) and OSS (always).

I don't remember how and where I stumbled onto [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but I find it interesting. I also find the [**Rust community**](https://github.com/rust-lang) very welcoming. I am progressing through [**THE BOOK**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and plan to write blogs about my Rust journey.

I also maintain (and use) the [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) Jekyll theme. As the name suggests, this theme features a simple, functional design with minimal CSS. I find it particularly useful for my needs and try to keep it updated regarding its dependencies.

I am also trying out [**Neovim**](https://neovim.io/). I have always used [**VS Code (Code - OSS)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for programming-related tasks. However, I wanted to switch to a Vim-based text editor partly because of its simplicity, to learn something new and to see if it fits my needs better.

I have diverse interests and don't confine myself to a few selected topics. I constantly learn new concepts, test emerging tools and frameworks (primarily open-source), and strive to contribute to the community.

That's all for now, but I'm committed to writing more blogs and honing my writing skills. Your support and feedback are always appreciated. :)
