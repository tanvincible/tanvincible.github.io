# Now  

### Academics

Lately, I’ve been focused on academics. My main areas of study include:  

1. **ECO111** – Economy, Society & Public Policy  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Sounak Thakur)*  
2. **EE655** – Computer Vision and Deep Learning  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula)*  
3. **ESO202** – Mechanics of Solids  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Gaurav Tiwari)*  
4. **ME222** – Nature and Properties of Materials  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Ushasi Roy)*  
5. **ME231** – Fluid Mechanics  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Anikesh Pal)*  
6. **ME252** – Theory of Mechanisms and Machines  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Anindya Chatterjee)*  
7. **ME261** – Primary Manufacturing Processes  
   *(Instructor: Prof. Virkeshwar Kumar)*  

I keep my notes organized in the [**IITK notes repository**](https://github.com/tanvincible/iitk).  

### Open Source & Programming

I enjoy working with open-source projects and currently maintain the Jekyll theme [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please), which has over **1.1k stars, 500+ forks on GitHub, and 37,000+ downloads on RubyGems**. I actively improve the theme and engage with its users.  

Beyond that, I contribute to [**Rust**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/) and [**sktime**](https://github.com/sktime/sktime).

I also have a strong interest in algorithms—whether it’s exploring optimization techniques, reading research papers, or tinkering with new approaches to problem-solving.  

### Writing & Documentation

Every now and then, I blog about things I find interesting — whether it’s a technical deep dive, an open-source experience, or just a random thought worth documenting. Writing helps me refine my ideas and keep track of what I’m learning.
