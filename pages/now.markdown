# Now  

### Open Source & Programming

I enjoy working with open-source projects and currently maintain the Jekyll theme [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please), which has over **1.1k stars, 500+ forks on GitHub, and 37,000+ downloads on RubyGems**. I actively improve the theme and engage with its users.  

Beyond that, I contribute to [**Rust**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/) and [**sktime**](https://github.com/sktime/sktime).

I also have a strong interest in algorithms—whether it’s exploring optimization techniques, reading research papers, or tinkering with new approaches to problem-solving.  

### Writing & Documentation

Every now and then, I blog about things I find interesting — whether it’s a technical deep dive, an open-source experience, or just a random thought worth documenting. Writing helps me refine my ideas and keep track of what I’m learning.
