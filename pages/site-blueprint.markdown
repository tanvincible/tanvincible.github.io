# Site Blueprint

This site is built with a minimalist approach using:

- **Static Site Generator**: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- **Hosting**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- **Version Control**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) + [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Theme

The design is based on the [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) theme.
