# About

Hello, I’m **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena** (she/her)!  
I’m currently a sophomore at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), majoring in [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/). My interests span **software engineering**, **machine learning**, **quantum computing**, and **web development**.

I maintain the [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) (1.1k+ stars (GitHub), 37k+ downloads ([**RubyGems**](https://rubygems.org/gems/no-style-please/versions/0.4.7?locale=en)))—a project I revived and continue to grow as its sole maintainer.  

I am also a regular contributor and mentee at [**sktime**](https://github.com/sktime/sktime), a Python framework for machine learning with time series. Broadly, I work on fixing bugs, writing docs and enhancing DL models for forecasting.

When I’m not coding or debugging, I’m likely exploring mathematical puzzles, learning new concepts, or brainstorming my next project. I believe in constantly iterating, whether it’s code or life.

I also maintain a [**now**](/now/) page.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always up for discussing new ideas!
