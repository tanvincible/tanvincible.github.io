# About

Hello, I’m **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena** (she/her)!  
I’m currently a sophomore at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), majoring in [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/). My interests span **numerical computing**, **algorithms** and **algorithmic number theory**.

I maintain the [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) (1.2k+ stars (GitHub), 38k+ downloads ([**RubyGems**](https://rubygems.org/gems/no-style-please/versions/0.4.7?locale=en)))—a project I revived and continue to grow as its sole maintainer.  

I also contribute to various open source projects. See my (incomplete list of) contributions [**here**](/os-contrib/).

When I’m not coding or debugging, I’m likely exploring mathematical puzzles, learning new concepts, or brainstorming my next project. I believe in constantly iterating, whether it’s code or life.

I also maintain a [**now**](/now/) page.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always up for discussing new ideas!
