# About

Hello, I’m **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena** (she/her)!  
I’m currently a sophomore at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), majoring in [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/), but my interests span **software engineering**, **machine learning**, **quantum computing**, and **web development**.

I maintain the [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme [**no-style-please**](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) (1.1k+ stars (GitHub), 37k+ downloads ([**RubyGems**](https://rubygems.org/gems/no-style-please/versions/0.4.7?locale=en)))—a project I revived and continue to grow as its sole maintainer.  
Beyond open source, I enjoy experimenting with tools, frameworks, and ideas to simplify workflows and scale solutions.

When I’m not coding or debugging, I’m likely exploring mathematical puzzles, pondering abstract theories, learning new concepts, or brainstorming my next project. I believe in constantly iterating, whether it’s code or life.

I also maintain a [**now**](/now/) page.

Feel free to reach out — I’m always up for discussing new ideas!
