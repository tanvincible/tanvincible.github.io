Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena**.  
I build things with code, explore number theory, and focus on simplifying complex problems.  

This site features my projects and work.

## About Me

Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student majoring in [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/) at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).  

Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m diving into the world of **machine learning** and **quantum computing**, always trying to connect dots between these fields and **number theory**. 

My goal is to keep pushing boundaries in these areas while sharing what I learn with others.
