Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena** â€” a builder, thinker, and problem-solver. 

Iâ€™m passionate about **number theory**, **machine learning**, and **quantum computing**, and I spend my time simplifying complex challenges. 

This site is a reflection of my work, thoughts, and the things Iâ€™m learning.

## About Me

Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student majoring in [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/) at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).  

Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m diving into the world of **machine learning** and **quantum computing**, always trying to connect dots between these fields and **number theory**. 

My goal is to keep pushing boundaries in these areas while sharing what I learn with others.
