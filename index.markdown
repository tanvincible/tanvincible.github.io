# tanvincible

Hello there! 👋  
I'm **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena** (she/her) — a builder, thinker, and problem-solver. 

This site is a reflection of my work, thoughts, and the things I’m learning.

## About Me

I’m currently an undergraduate student majoring in [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/) at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).  

I’m passionate about **number theory**, **software development**, **machine learning**, and **quantum computing**, and I spend my time simplifying complex challenges. 

My goal is to keep pushing boundaries in these areas while sharing what I learn with others.
