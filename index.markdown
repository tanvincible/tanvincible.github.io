Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Tanvi Pooranmal Meena**.  
I build things with code, explore number theory, and focus on simplifying complex problems.  

This site features my projects and work.

## About Me

I'm currently studying [**Mechanical Engineering**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/) at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) and exploring the intersection of **number theory**, **machine learning**, and **quantum computing**.  
My goal is to contribute meaningfully to these fields and continue learning throughout my career.
